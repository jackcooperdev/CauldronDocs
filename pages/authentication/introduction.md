# Cauldron Authentication

## What does this do?

Cauldron Authentication is responsible for authenticating Minecraft Users using
the [Microsoft Authentication System](https://wiki.vg/Microsoft_Authentication_Scheme) which is the only way to log in
to Mojang now.
This package provides all the tools needed to acquire a Minecraft Access token from an oauth token.

## Setup

To Install the package, run the following command

```
npm i @jackcooper04/cauldronauthentication --save
```

## Using Cauldron Authentication

Cauldron Authentication is split into multiple exports. They are listed below.

## Functions

### startAuthenticationFlow (azureCredentials, refreshToken)

This function performs the authentication flow turning a refresh token into a minecraft access token and getting the
profile information for the user.

It takes the following parameters

- azureCredentials (Required)

```json
{
  "CLIENT_ID": "AZURE_CLIENT_ID",
  "REDIRECT_URI": "REDIRECT_URL",
  "VERIFY_CODE": "CODE_USED_TO_VERIFY_LOGINS"
}
```

- refreshToken (Required): Refresh Token from original oauth flow

On completion, the function will return two objects one to save in a file and another that can be used to launch a
Minecraft Session.

### Sample Output

```json
{
  "toSave": {
    "refresh_token": "REFRESH_TOKEN",
    "xuid": "0000000000000000",
    "user_id": "aaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaa",
    "access_token": "ACCESS_TOKEN",
    "username": "Notch",
    "uuid": "069a79f444e94726a5befca90e38aaf5"
  },
  "toReturn": {
    "profile": {
      "uuid": "069a79f444e94726a5befca90e38aaf5",
