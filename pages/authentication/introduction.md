## What does this do?

Cauldron Authentication is responsible for authenticating Minecraft Users using the [Microsoft Authentication System](https://wiki.vg/Microsoft_Authentication_Scheme) which is the only way to login to Mojang now. This package provides all the tools needed to aquire a Minecraft Access token from a oauth token.

## Setup

To Install the package run the following command

```
npm i @jackcooper04/cauldronauthentication --save
```

## Using Cauldron Authentication

Cauldron Authentication is split into multiple exports. They are listed below.

## Functions

### startAuthenticationFlow (azureCredentials, refreshToken)

This function performs the authentication flow turning a refresh token into a minecraft access token and getting the profile information for the user.

It takes the following parameters

- azureCredentials (Required)

```json
{
  "CLIENT_ID": "AZURE_CLIENT_ID",
  "REDIRECT_URI": "REDIECT_URL",
  "VERIFY_CODE": "CODE_USED_TO_VERIFY_LOGINS"
}
```

- refreshToken (Required) - Refresh Token from original oauth flow

On completion the function will return two objects one to save in a file and another that can be used to launch a Minecraft Session.

  "toSave": {
    "refresh_token": "REFRESH_TOKEN",
