# Welcome to Cauldron
 
## What is Cauldron?
Cauldron is a collection of projects aiming to create a web based minecraft launcher that allows for the user to create and share profiles (both vanilla and modded) to friends. In the future more social aspects aim to be created also server creation tools are going to be added.

## Why?
Recently the offical minecraft launcher has become larger and larger and boot times have slowed down. Additionaly I wanted to create a mod launcher which is simple to use (like CurseForge) but make it easier to share private modpacks with friends without having to share modpack files every time a change is made. 


## Projects inside Cauldron
 - Cauldron Engine (Responsible for Downloading and Running Minecraft Instances)
 - Cauldron Authentication (Responsible for Authenticating Minecraft Users)
 - Cauldron Server (REST API)
 - Cauldron Agent (Client that manages profiles and provides an local REST interface for other applications to use)
 - packwiz_js (NodeJS package that assists in creating / converting packwiz modpacks to JSON)
