# Welcome to Cauldron

## What is Cauldron?

Cauldron is a collection of projects
aiming to create a web-based minecraft launcher that allows for the user to create and share profiles
(both vanilla and modded) to friends.
In the future, more social aspects will aim to be created;
also server creation tools are planned to be added allowing for seamless server creation from profiles.

## Why?

Recently, the official minecraft launcher has become larger and larger and boot times have slowed down.
Additionally,
I wanted to create a mod launcher which is straightforward to use (like CurseForge)
but make it easier to share private modpacks with friends
without having to share modpack files every time a change is made.

This project is not meant to replace any existing projects
(such as [minecraft-launcher-core-node](https://github.com/Voxelum/minecraft-launcher-core-node) by Voxelum)
and is more to prove to myself that I can complete a project from start to finish.
This project will always be free to use when ready for release and will remain open-sourced.
With that in mind, this project aims
to create a flexible system where profiles and modpacks can be shared seamlessly through different clients,
for example, a web-based client or through discord.
