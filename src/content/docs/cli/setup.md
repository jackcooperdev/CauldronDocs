This guide shows you show to set up / login to CauldronCLI

There are two ways to set up CauldronCLI:

## Through The CLI:

Usage:
```bash
cauldroncli setup
```

This function will perform the following actions:

1. Download JVM amd Packwiz
2. Log you Into CauldronAPI
3. Ask if you would like to add a Minecraft Account

> You can change the root path by changing the variable in cauldroncli_admin.json which exists in your user folder. 
> After changing the path it is recommended to run `cauldroncli reset` or `cauldroncli uninstall`.

Once these actions are completed the cli is ready to be used.
