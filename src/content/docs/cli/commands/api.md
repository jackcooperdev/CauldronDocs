These commands manage credentials linked to the CLI to access the API. They can be run in two ways

## Though the CLI

### login
Login to CauldronAPI


Usage:
```bash
cauldroncli add
```

This opens a web browser prompting the user to log in to CauldronAPI.

### logout
Logout from CauldronAPI

Usage:
```bash
cauldroncli remove
```

This removes the account from the CLI.
